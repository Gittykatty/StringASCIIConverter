# StringASCIIConverter
Script for Converting String Input into ASCII Output.
Input is a string.
Output is in dec, hex and 4-Byte hex notation (In example for converting string AES256-Keys into 4-Byte Chunks of ASCII-hex).

NOTE: With adjusting the 'splitSize' variable, you adjust the size of the byte-blocks.
